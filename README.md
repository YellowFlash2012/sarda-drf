# sarda-drf
DRF Masterclass

A REST API built with DRF with inspiration from this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/django-rest-framework/">course</a>.

# key learning points:
1- the serializers and the different methods used to serialized the models has been the key learning point and in fact the main reason why I took the course to begin with

2- how the url patterns cascade from the main project to the individual apps.

3- custom user model, the course didn't touch on this but I did my own research and came up with something that I need to polish because it doesn't work well as I was expecting it.
